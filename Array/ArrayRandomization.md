**Array Randomization**

-> The randomization will work on the data structures like arrays also. \
-> Keyword is "rand" or "randc".

---Static Array---
-> The syntax is simple we can use simply 'rand' and the in initial we can use '.randomize()'. \
-> This is simple as the size of static array wont change. 

---Dynamic Array (All Dynamic Arrays)---
-> As in the dynamic array the size is not fixed we need a 'Constraint' or 'with' statement. \
-> This will limit the range in which we have to check the results.
